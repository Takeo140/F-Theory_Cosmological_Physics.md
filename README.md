F-Theory: Cosmological PhysicsThe Mathematical Foundation of the Universe
1. ConceptThis framework reconstructs the fundamental laws of the universe based on a single meta-axiom: the Extremum Principle ($\delta\mathcal{A}=0$).The complete correspondence between physical reality (Obverse) and mathematical structure (Reverse) is formally verified using Lean 4.
2. Axioms (Formalized in Cosmology.lean)Extremum Principle: Systems evolve to minimize action and information dissipation.Obverse-Reverse Correspondence: Material reality and mathematical logic are connected via continuous mapping.Logical Consistency: The universe functions as a self-consistent formal system.
3. The Logic of "Zero Cost"Physical Definition: "Cost" is defined as entropy production and information dissipation (friction).The Principle: In an extremal state, dissipation mathematically converges to zero.Conclusion: Applying this architecture to industrial systems (e.g., GPU computing) eliminates systemic waste, reducing costs (on the scale of 100 billion JPY) as a matter of physical necessity.
4. Formal EvidenceThe Lean 4 code in this repository serves as mathematical proof that this logical structure is consistent and free of contradictions.
